Data leakage is a critical issue in many organizations, particularly those that rely on multi-agent systems where data is shared across various entities. These systems often face challenges in ensuring that sensitive data is not improperly disclosed or mishandled. Unauthorized dissemination of data, either due to human error or malicious intent, can lead to severe consequences, including financial loss, legal ramifications, and damage to an organizationâ€™s reputation. The complexity of identifying the source of data leaks increases when multiple agents are involved, as each agent has access to different pieces of information, often with alterations to the original data.

Current methods for detecting and preventing data leakage tend to be reactive rather than proactive. Many existing solutions do not provide a clear way to trace data leaks back to the originating source or agent. This lack of traceability makes it difficult for organizations to hold responsible parties accountable, and to prevent future occurrences.

The goal of this project is to address these issues by developing a Data Leakage Detection System that allocates data entries and alterations to individual agents and tracks their usage. The system will allow users to input agent details, allocate data and its corresponding alterations, and store this information in a structured manner. When a leak is suspected, the system will compare the leaked data and alterations with stored data entries to identify the responsible agent, ensuring accountability and data security.

Implemented as a terminal-based application, this system will provide a simple yet effective solution to the problem of data leakage detection. The system allows users to input data about agents and their allocated data, track the number of entries, and detect leaks by checking leaked data against existing records. By detecting leaks proactively, this system helps organizations minimize the impact of data breaches and enhance their data governance.

This approach, focused on monitoring data alterations and allocations, will provide a scalable and memory-efficient way to safeguard sensitive information, improving both the security and accountability of multi-agent systems.
